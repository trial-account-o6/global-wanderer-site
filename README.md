## Live Demo
Visit the deployed site on GitHub Pages: https://trial-account-o6.github.io/global-wanderer-site/

## Local Development
1. Clone the repository and install any desired tooling (the page depends only on CDN resources, so no build step is required).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or run a simple static server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to preview the site.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Push the latest changes to the `main` or `master` branch.
2. In the GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select the default branch (e.g., `master`) and the root (`/`) directory, then click **Save**.
5. Wait for GitHub Pages to finish building; your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Footer Credit
The footer now displays: `© 2026 Global Wanderer - Built by Pi Agent` to clearly attribute the build.
